This repository contains resources extracted from the Macintosh versions of AOL 1.0 and AOL 2.6. These applications, especially the pictures and icons, are very sepcial to me even though I'm not old enough to have used either of those versions. At a friends of the library booksale, I found a Tom Lichty AOL book - not exactly sure which one, as it was that long ago. But I was enraptured by the AOL visual style. The icons were so different from the Windows 3.1 and Windows 98 icons I was so used to. 

I don't have that book anymore, but based on these resources the version used in that book must have been AOL 2.6 or something similar. 

The raw resources were extracted with an un-remembered tool many years ago, but the PNG images were created with the awesome [rsrcdump](https://github.com/jorio/rsrcdump) library. Maybe someday the extraction workflow can be fully automated so more people can enjoy these great pieces of art.
